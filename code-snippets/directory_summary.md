# Summary of the Code Snippets Directory

- [get_abs_cnv.py] takes a cnv expression file (either one where levels are 1 - 6 (1 resembling high loss of gene copy numbers, 6 high copynumber overexpression of gene) or one of distribution centered around one). The value around which is centered needs to be taken into account in th code ;-)
  The code returns the mean copynumber variation either for all genes or only for marker genes. This also needs to be edited in the code depending on what is to be acheived.
